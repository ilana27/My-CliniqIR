occurred 14 years earlier and for which percutaneous balloon angioplasty of the first marginal branch of the left circumflex artery had been performed Nine years before the current admission a cardiac stress test with radionuclide imaging revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 33 and a reversible anterolateral defect subsequent cardiac catheterization revealed severe disease in the right coronary artery and in branches of the left circumflex artery Seven months before the current admission echocardiography revealed that the left ventricular ejection fraction had worsened to 22 and a subsequent cardiac stress test with radionuclide imaging performed at this hospital revealed a markedly dilated left ventricle with large dense inferior and lateral scars and associated minimal inferoapical ischemia Eleven weeks before the current admission transthoracic echocardiography performed at this hospital revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 23 dilatation of the left atrium anteroposterior dimension 39 mm and left ventricle end diastolic dimension 55 mm diffuse hypokinesis of both ventricles mild in the right and severe in the left mild mitral and tricuspid regurgitation and no pericardial effusion Three weeks later 8 weeks before the current admission the patient was seen in the cardiac arrhythmia clinic of this hospital to be evaluated for the placement of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator ICD He reported exertional dyspnea that was consistent with a New York Heart Association NYHA functional class of II He had no palpitations presyncopal symptoms syncopal events orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea His weight was stable His medications were aspirin irbesartan carvedilol hydrochlorothiazide isosorbide mononitrate atorvastatin metformin sitagliptin and loratadine He was allergic to penicillin and cephalosporins which caused a rash and he reported cough with the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors He was married and had adult children He had a smoking history of 45 pack years but had stopped smoking 29 years earlier and he had recently decreased alcohol consumption from 10 drinks per week to 4 on the advice of his clinicians he did not use illicit drugs Several relatives had diabetes mellitus On examination at that visit the blood pressure was 110 70 mm Hg the pulse 60 beats per minute the respiratory rate 12 breaths per minute and the body mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters The jugular venous pressure was 6 cm of water the remainder of the examination was normal with no cardiac murmur or rub Placement of an ICD was advised Ten days before the current admission a dual chamber ICD system was inserted through the left axillary vein Intravenous vancomycin was administered immediately before the procedure Immediately after the procedure the patient was admitted to this hospital for routine monitoring Chest radiographs that were obtained after the procedure and the following morning showed the ICD pulse generator on the left side of the chest with ICD lead tips projecting over the right atrium and right ventricle as well as clear and inflated lungs mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette which was stable as compared with the silhouette seen on earlier radiographs and no pleural effusion or pneumothorax Laboratory test results are shown in The morning after ICD placement repeat device interrogation was performed and all measurements were within acceptable limits The patient was discharged home later that day During the next 9 days he noted occasional mild positional pain at the ICD placement site that was relieved with acetaminophen No skin changes or swelling at the ICD placement site were noted At 6 p m on the day of the current admission midsternal chest discomfort and associated diaphoresis and mild dyspnea developed suddenly while the patient was watching television The pain was exacerbated by movement and deep inspiration did not radiate was possibly improved by leaning forward and was distinct from the pain at the ICD placement site that had been previously reported The patient had no associated headache light headedness palpitations cough nausea vomiting fever or chills He took two acetaminophen tablets for the pain and after it lasted for more than 1 hour he sought medical attention On arrival in the emergency department approximately 5 hours after the onset of symptoms the patient rated the pain at rest at 0 on a scale of 0 to 10 with 10 indicating the most severe pain The midsternal pain could be reproduced with deep inspiration he rated that pain at 7 of On examination the temperature was 1 C the blood pressure 130 70 mm Hg the pulse 78 beats per minute and irregular the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute and the oxygen saturation 96 while the patient was breathing ambient air The skin was cool with no inflammation or hematoma over the ICD placement site Adhesive strips over the incision were intact The first and second heart sounds were normal with no murmur and the breath sounds were slightly diminished at the bases The jugular venous pressure was not recorded and the remainder of the examination was normal Cardiac telemetry showed sinus rhythm with occasional premature ventricular contractions Blood levels of electrolytes calcium and phosphorus were normal other test results are shown in Posteroanterior and lateral chest radiographs 1 showed a new left pleural effusion with no other clinically significant changes as compared with the chest radiograph that was obtained immediately after the procedure The cardiomediastinal silhouette was within normal limits and the ICD leads appeared to be in a position similar to that on the previous radiograph Cardiac ultrasonography performed at the bedside by emergency department personnel revealed trace pericardial effusion and decreased ventricular contractile function An electrocardiogram ECG showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 66 beats per minute with new ST segment elevations in ECG leads II III aVF V3 and V4 2 Aspirin magnesium sulfate and insulin were administered Twenty six minutes later approximately 3 hours after the patient s presentation severe pain recurred Fentanyl was administered intravenously Approximately 30 minutes after the onset of this pain light headedness dizziness diaphoresis nausea and transient hypotension blood pressure 67 44 mm Hg occurred with a pulse of 59 beats per minute These symptoms spontaneously improved within minutes the systolic blood pressure rose to 92 mm Hg and subsequently ranged between 80 and 92 mm Hg and the pulse ranged between 57 and 64 beats per minute Vancomycin was administered Five hours after presentation the patient was admitted to the cardiology service On arrival the blood pressure was 120 55 mm Hg and the pulse was 65 beats per minute with an inspiratory decline in systolic pressure of less than 5 mm Hg Breath sounds were diminished at the left base the jugular venous pressure was 9 cm of water and there were normal heart sounds with no rubs or murmurs the remainder of the

day of the current admission midsternal chest discomfort and associated diaphoresis and mild dyspnea developed suddenly while the patient was watching television The pain was exacerbated by movement and deep inspiration did not radiate was possibly improved by leaning forward and was distinct from the pain at the ICD placement site that had been previously reported The patient had no associated headache light headedness palpitations cough nausea vomiting fever or chills He took two acetaminophen tablets for the pain and after it lasted for more than 1 hour he sought medical attention On arrival in the emergency department approximately 5 hours after the onset of symptoms the patient rated the pain at rest at 0 on a scale of 0 to 10 with 10 indicating the most severe pain The midsternal pain could be reproduced with deep inspiration he rated that pain at 7 of On examination the temperature was 1 C the blood pressure 130 70 mm Hg the pulse 78 beats per minute and irregular the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute and the oxygen saturation 96 while the patient was breathing ambient air The skin was cool with no inflammation or hematoma over the ICD placement site Adhesive strips over the incision were intact The first and second heart sounds were normal with no murmur and the breath sounds were slightly diminished at the bases The jugular venous pressure was not recorded and the remainder of the examination was normal Cardiac telemetry showed sinus rhythm with occasional premature ventricular contractions Blood levels of electrolytes calcium and phosphorus were normal other test results are shown in Posteroanterior and lateral chest radiographs 1 showed a new left pleural effusion with no other clinically significant changes as compared with the chest radiograph that was obtained immediately after the procedure The cardiomediastinal silhouette was within normal limits and the ICD leads appeared to be in a position similar to that on the previous radiograph Cardiac ultrasonography performed at the bedside by emergency department personnel revealed trace pericardial effusion and decreased ventricular contractile function An electrocardiogram ECG showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 66 beats per minute with new ST segment elevations in ECG leads II III aVF V3 and V4 2 Aspirin magnesium sulfate and insulin were administered Twenty six minutes later approximately 3 hours after the patient s presentation severe pain recurred Fentanyl was administered intravenously Approximately 30 minutes after the onset of this pain light headedness dizziness diaphoresis nausea and transient hypotension blood pressure 67 44 mm Hg occurred with a pulse of 59 beats per minute These symptoms spontaneously improved within minutes the systolic blood pressure rose to 92 mm Hg and subsequently ranged between 80 and 92 mm Hg and the pulse ranged between 57 and 64 beats per minute Vancomycin was administered Five hours after presentation the patient was admitted to the cardiology service On arrival the blood pressure was 120 55 mm Hg and the pulse was 65 beats per minute with an inspiratory decline in systolic pressure of less than 5 mm Hg Breath sounds were diminished at the left base the jugular venous pressure was 9 cm of water and there were normal heart sounds with no rubs or murmurs the remainder of the examination was unchanged A repeat chest radiograph was unchanged as compared with a radiograph obtained on admission Approximately 13 hours after the patient s presentation diagnostic procedures were

stay for pacemaker placement he was seen in the primary care clinic with a 5 day history of diarrhea lower abdominal pain and tenderness The weight was 3 kg A stool culture was negative for enteric pathogens and a test for was positive A 10 day course of oral metronidazole was prescribed the frequency of diarrhea initially decreased but returned to three or four times a day after the medication was stopped A 14 day course of oral vancomycin was prescribed and the symptoms abated Sixteen months before this admission severe abdominal pain in the right lower quadrant developed acutely and the patient presented to the emergency department at this hospital He reported feeling weak the right lower quadrant was tender on palpation Laboratory test results are shown in Additional imaging studies were obtained CT of the abdomen and pelvis performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material revealed persistent irregular wall thickening of the terminal ileum with mild adjacent inflammatory fat stranding Fig 2B Hemodialysis was performed and the patient was admitted to the hospital Ciprofloxacin and metronidazole were administered and the abdominal pain improved during the next 3 days A stool culture and examinations for ova and parasites were negative and a test for was positive ciprofloxacin was discontinued and the patient was discharged with a prescription for a 14 day course of oral metronidazole Thirteen months before this admission the patient returned to the gastroenterology clinic He reported that he had had three or four loose nonbloody bowel movements each day for several weeks with associated generalized abdominal pain His appetite continued to be reduced and he felt weak and fatigued The weight was 8 kg and the abdominal examination was normal Laboratory test results are shown in CT angiography of the abdomen and pelvis had been performed 2 days before this visit to the gastroenterology clinic during routine follow up after a recent endovascular procedure for the repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm The imaging studies revealed an increase in the circumferential wall thickening of the terminal ileum and cecum Fig 2C A diagnosis of Crohn s disease was considered Treatment with prednisone and methotrexate was recommended but the patient declined the treatment Eleven weeks before this admission generalized weakness diffuse abdominal discomfort and tenderness and hypotension developed during an outpatient hemodialysis session The patient was admitted to the hospital and fever to a temperature of 4 C developed Cefepime

diplopia and weakness The patient was in his usual health until approximately 2 weeks before admission when nausea dizziness tinnitus and unsteady gait developed these symptoms were associated with subjective fevers Five days before admission a diagnosis of respiratory infection with inner ear symptoms was made the symptoms decreased transiently Three days before admission the patient awoke at 4 a m and noted diminished muscle control which was more severe in the arms than in the legs and shaking in the hands Reaching for his eyeglasses required intense concentration and slowing of reaching movements He had difficulty rising and was unable to walk He was admitted to another hospital where sequential examinations revealed fluctuating arm weakness and dysarthria which sometimes lessened with repeated testing The complete blood count white cell differential count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were normal as were blood levels of electrolytes glucose and C reactive protein results of tests of renal and liver function were also reportedly normal A chest radiograph reportedly showed small bilateral pleural effusions with no consolidation or pneumothorax Results of computed tomography CT of the head performed without the administration of contrast material and CT angiography of the head and neck were reportedly normal Cerebrospinal fluid CSF obtained by lumbar puncture contained 4 red cells and 188 white cells per cubic millimeter with 88 lymphocytes 5 segmented neutrophils and 7 monocytes Other test results were pending Results of electromyography were reportedly normal Antibiotic agents and prednisone were administered During the hospitalization horizontal diplopia developed which disappeared when one eye was covered On the third evening sweats and chills occurred The next day he was transferred to this hospital On admission the patient reported diplopia tremors that were more pronounced in his arms than in his legs and that worsened when he used those limbs increased urinary frequency night sweats and chills with no numbness tingling pain headaches neck stiffness shortness of breath nausea vomiting diarrhea or rashes He had had worsening heart failure during the previous 4 years and a diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis had been made 16 months before admission after evaluation by positron emission tomography PET and CT of the chest had revealed increased high 18F fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in lymph nodes of the chest and abdomen Pathological examination of tissue obtained by means of mediastinoscopy had reportedly revealed confluent nonnecrotizing granulomas with extensive hyalinization silver and acid fast staining had shown no organisms A 4 month course of prednisone was administered between 16 months and 12 months before this admission Four months before this admission a 4 month course of prednisone and methotrexate was begun and was completed shortly before the onset of symptoms The patient also had hyperlipidemia coronary artery disease with stent placement congestive heart failure complete heart block ventricular arrhythmias for which an automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator had been implanted mild asthma associated with allergies which he had had since childhood allergic rhinitis and recent dental surgery for which he had received unknown antibiotics for a period of 7 days Medications were cholecalciferol doxazosin atorvastatin sotalol low dose aspirin folic acid a multivitamin fluticasone by inhalation enoxaparin subcutaneously and as needed ipratropium by inhalation and nitroglycerin sublingually He had received that year s seasonal influenza vaccine He lived with his wife and worked in an office He did not drink alcohol smoke or use illicit drugs His mother was more than 90 years of age and had a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate which was being treated with prednisone his father had had a stroke and his siblings were healthy On examination the patient was alert and oriented The temperature was 2 C the blood pressure 93 53 mm Hg the pulse 75 beats per minute the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute and the oxygen saturation 93 while the patient was breathing ambient air He had subtle deficits in episodic memory including difficulty in recounting elements of his own recent medical history The pupils were round and reactive to light constricting from 3 mm in diameter to 2 mm Extraocular movements were full without nystagmus or saccadic breakdown He had horizontal diplopia in all directions with mild ptosis of the right eyelid Tremors of the cheeks occurred on smiling and the patient was unable to puff out his cheeks Other cranial nerve examinations were normal however the first cranial nerve was not tested Motor examination revealed myoclonus of the arms with no fasciculation or cogwheel rigidity Strength was rated 4 out of 5 in the fingers on the left hand with extension and was otherwise rated 5 out of Light touch sensation was preserved throughout The deep tendon reflexes were rated 1 and were symmetric at the triceps biceps brachioradialis quadriceps gastrocnemius and soleus Plantar responses were mute on both feet There was prominent arm shaking on finger to nose testing when the patient s eyes were open the shaking was less pronounced when his eyes were closed Rapid alternating movements were normal as were the results of heel to shin testing and mirroring testing Gait and stance were not tested Blood levels of troponin T were normal as were results of urine analysis and renal function tests other test results are shown in Blood and urine cultures were obtained One dose of cefepime was administered followed by ceftriaxone vancomycin and ampicillin and cardiac and bronchodilator medications During the first hospital day nausea and vomiting occurred and the temperature rose to 8 C Sequential neurologic examinations initially revealed increased somnolence decreased orientation and ability to be aroused slow verbal responses with dysfluent speech and no evidence of dysarthria or dysphagia Diplopia right eyelid ptosis and coarse omnidirectional nystagmus in the primary position i e when the patient was looking forward were present with no nuchal rigidity Cytologic examination of CSF obtained by means of lumbar puncture revealed an increased number of lymphocytes and background proteinaceous debris other laboratory test results are shown in Gram s staining of a sputum specimen showed no leukocytes a moderate number of squamous epithelial cells and mixed flora sputum cultures grew very few enteric gram negative rods and and normal flora Blood and urine cultures remained sterile The temperature rose to 1 C Acyclovir was added on the second hospital day On the third hospital day glucocorticoids were begun for hypotension On the fourth hospital day hyponatremia and progressive generalized weakness occurred and fevers continued CT images of the head on the fourth hospital day obtained before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material were normal for the patient s age 1A Indirect immunofluorescence testing for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies was negative Portable electroencephalography revealed generalized rhythmic delta activity and bifrontal triphasic waves with diffuse irregular delta theta slowing Lorazepam was administered which resulted in improvement in generalized rhythmic delta activity but not in mental status On the fifth hospital day somnolence increased and mental status worsened Cytologic examination of CSF obtained by means of a repeat lumbar puncture showed an increased number of lymphocytes with admixed neutrophils macrophages and occasional plasma cells and no evidence of malignant cells other laboratory test results are shown in Pressors for hypotension were administered intravenously morphine sulfate and propofol were administered the trachea was intubated and mechanical ventilation begun The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit The next day blood levels of thyrotropin vitamin B12 folate and cortisol were normal as were results of liver function tests testing for 1 3 betaglucan was negative Methylprednisolone and amiodarone were begun and sotalol was stopped Liposomal amphotericin was administered for 2 days On the seventh hospital day levetiracetam was begun The next day the level of N terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide was 8227 pg per milliliter reference range 0 to 900 and troponin T levels remained low On the ninth hospital day another lumbar puncture was performed and the CSF was analyzed 1 Later that evening the pupils became nonreactive Neurosurgical consultation was obtained and additional imaging studies were performed Contrast enhanced CT of the head revealed new extensive hypoattenuation in the periventricular and subcortical white matter sulcal effacement and marked expansion of the corpus callosum which indicated brain swelling and edema Leptomeningeal

diplopia and weakness The patient was in his usual health until approximately 2 weeks before admission when nausea dizziness tinnitus and unsteady gait developed these symptoms were associated with subjective fevers Five days before admission a diagnosis of respiratory infection with inner ear symptoms was made the symptoms decreased transiently Three days before admission the patient awoke at 4 a m and noted diminished muscle control which was more severe in the arms than in the legs and shaking in the hands Reaching for his eyeglasses required intense concentration and slowing of reaching movements He had difficulty rising and was unable to walk He was admitted to another hospital where sequential examinations revealed fluctuating arm weakness and dysarthria which sometimes lessened with repeated testing The complete blood count white cell differential count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were normal as were blood levels of electrolytes glucose and C reactive protein results of tests of renal and liver function were also reportedly normal A chest radiograph reportedly showed small bilateral pleural effusions with no consolidation or pneumothorax Results of computed tomography CT of the head performed without the administration of contrast material and CT angiography of the head and neck were reportedly normal Cerebrospinal fluid CSF obtained by lumbar puncture contained 4 red cells and 188 white cells per cubic millimeter with 88 lymphocytes 5 segmented neutrophils and 7 monocytes Other test results were pending Results of electromyography were reportedly normal Antibiotic agents and prednisone were administered During the hospitalization horizontal diplopia developed which disappeared when one eye was covered On the third evening sweats and chills occurred The next day he was transferred to this hospital On admission the patient reported diplopia tremors that were more pronounced in his arms than in his legs and that worsened when he used those limbs increased urinary frequency night sweats and chills with no numbness tingling pain headaches neck stiffness shortness of breath nausea vomiting diarrhea or rashes He had had worsening heart failure during the previous 4 years and a diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis had been made 16 months before admission after evaluation by positron emission tomography PET and CT of the chest had revealed increased high 18F fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in lymph nodes of the chest and abdomen Pathological examination of tissue obtained by means of mediastinoscopy had reportedly revealed confluent nonnecrotizing granulomas with extensive hyalinization silver and acid fast staining had shown no organisms A 4 month course of prednisone was administered between 16 months and 12 months before this admission Four months before this admission a 4 month course of prednisone and methotrexate was begun and was completed shortly before the onset of symptoms The patient also had hyperlipidemia coronary artery disease with stent placement congestive heart failure complete heart block ventricular arrhythmias for which an automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator had been implanted mild

to 2 mm Extraocular movements were full without nystagmus or saccadic breakdown He had horizontal diplopia in all directions with mild ptosis of the right eyelid Tremors of the cheeks occurred on smiling and the patient was unable to puff out his cheeks Other cranial nerve examinations were normal however the first cranial nerve was not tested Motor examination revealed myoclonus of the arms with no fasciculation or cogwheel rigidity Strength was rated 4 out of 5 in the fingers on the left hand with extension and was otherwise rated 5 out of Light touch sensation was preserved throughout The deep tendon reflexes were rated 1 and were symmetric at the triceps biceps brachioradialis quadriceps gastrocnemius and soleus Plantar responses were mute on both feet There was prominent arm shaking on finger to nose testing when the patient s eyes were open the shaking was less pronounced when his eyes were closed Rapid alternating movements were normal as were the results of heel to shin testing and mirroring testing Gait and stance were not tested Blood levels of troponin T were normal as were results of urine analysis and renal function tests other test results are shown in

nausea and vomiting occurred and the temperature rose to 8 C Sequential neurologic examinations initially revealed increased somnolence decreased orientation and ability to be aroused slow verbal responses with dysfluent speech and no evidence of dysarthria or dysphagia Diplopia right eyelid ptosis and coarse omnidirectional nystagmus in the primary position i e when the patient was looking forward were present with no nuchal rigidity Cytologic examination of CSF obtained by means of lumbar puncture revealed an increased number of lymphocytes and background proteinaceous debris other laboratory test results are shown in Gram s staining of a sputum specimen showed no leukocytes a moderate number of squamous epithelial cells and mixed flora sputum cultures grew very few enteric gram negative rods and and normal flora Blood and urine cultures remained sterile The temperature rose to 1 C Acyclovir was added on the second hospital day On the third hospital day glucocorticoids were

after the administration of intravenous contrast material were normal for the patient s age 1A Indirect immunofluorescence testing for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies was negative Portable electroencephalography revealed generalized rhythmic delta activity and bifrontal triphasic waves with diffuse irregular delta theta slowing Lorazepam was administered which resulted in improvement in generalized rhythmic delta activity but not in mental status On the fifth hospital day somnolence increased and mental status worsened Cytologic examination of CSF obtained by means of a repeat lumbar

HS-ibuprofen,A 21 year old woman was admitted to this hospital during the winter because of fever headache and myalgias The patient had been well until 4 days before this admission when fever chills fatigue malaise retro orbital headache and photophobia developed On presentation to a clinic affiliated with the university where she was a student she reported that 6 days earlier she had returned from a trip to Indonesia A blood smear examination for malaria was negative and the patient was advised to take acetaminophen and ibuprofen Over the next 2 days her symptoms worsened and abdominal pain in the left lower quadrant and arthralgias affecting the knees developed On the third day of illness she presented to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation On examination at the other hospital the temperature was 0 C The blood lactic acid level and results of liver function tests were normal other laboratory test results are shown in Tests for heterophile antibodies influenza and were negative Blood and urine specimens were obtained for culture and a lumbar puncture was performed on cerebrospinal fluid analysis the white cell and red cell counts and protein and glucose levels were normal Chest radiography revealed no evidence of focal consolidation pulmonary edema or hilar adenopathy Abdominal radiography revealed multiple air filled loops of small bowel but no evidence of abnormal bowel dilatation obstruction or free air Four hours later computed tomography CT of the abdomen and pelvis performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material revealed the presence of a few subcentimeter mesenteric lymph nodes in the right lower quadrant There was no bowel wall thickening obstruction ascites or hepatosplenomegaly The kidneys were heterogeneous in appearance Acetaminophen was administered and the patient was admitted to the hospital High temperatures persisted cooling blankets were applied and more than 7 liters of fluid were administered intravenously On the second hospital day intravenous doxycycline and ceftriaxone were administered Three blood smear examinations for malaria a stool culture for enteric pathogens and a stool examination for ova and parasites were negative other laboratory test results are shown in By the third hospital day cough and mild chest pain had developed and hypoxemia was reportedly present supplemental oxygen was administered initially through a nasal cannula at a flow rate of 4 liters per minute and then through a nonrebreather face mask at a flow rate of 15 liters per minute Repeat chest radiography revealed diffuse hazy opacities predominantly in the lower lobes with new opacification of the left hemidiaphragm 1A Headache and photophobia persisted A CT scan of the head was normal Doxycycline was continued ceftriaxone was discontinued and vancomycin and piperacillin tazobactam were administered intravenously The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit ICU at the other hospital In the ICU the blood levels of lactic acid amylase lipase and creatine kinase were normal and tests for rheumatoid factor antinuclear antibodies and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were negative other laboratory test results are shown in An electrocardiogram and a transthoracic echocardiogram were normal Furosemide was administered intravenously and the patient had 3 liters of urine output Therapy with oral oseltamivir and a continuous intravenous infusion of sodium bicarbonate was begun and the patient was transferred by helicopter to the medical ICU at this hospital On admission to this hospital the patient reported that fevers had occurred without periodicity and that photophobia headache and diffuse myalgias persisted She had a history of anxiety and exercise induced asthma and a remote history of tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy Her only medication was citalopram and she had no known allergies She was a college student and lived with roommates in a rural area of New England Twenty seven days before the onset of illness she had returned from a 10 day trip to the U S Virgin Islands Six days before the onset of illness she had returned from a 16 day ecology tour in rural Indonesia she had traveled through the United Arab Emirates in transit to Indonesia and the passenger seated next to her on the flight from the United Arab Emirates to Indonesia coughed intermittently during the trip The patient did not receive any vaccinations before the trip and did not take malaria prophylaxis While she was in Indonesia she used mosquito netting during sleep but received multiple mosquito bites She drank boiled water and pasteurized milk and ate rice and beans thoroughly cooked meat and fruit that had been washed but not peeled She visited jungles and plantations and had contact with elephants a bovine calf and a juvenile macaque She also observed but did not have contact with cats dogs bats chickens and cattle She swam in jungle streams ponds and a waterfall pool She reported that at the midpoint of the trip a mild nonpainful nonpruritic rash developed the rash first appeared on the wrists spread centripetally and became diffuse and then resolved She was monogamous with her boyfriend and they used condoms inconsistently She did not smoke tobacco but she smoked marijuana occasionally and drank alcohol rarely On examination the patient was irritable and appeared tired The temperature was 2 C the pulse 80 beats per minute the blood pressure 112 57 mm Hg the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute and the oxygen saturation 97 while she was receiving supplemental oxygen through a high flow nasal cannula at a flow rate of 50 liters per minute with a fraction of inspired oxygen of 5 She had a few petechiae on the palate palpebral conjunctival injection and mild neck stiffness On auscultation of the chest there were rales over both lung bases There was mild diffuse abdominal tenderness that was worst in the left lower quadrant as well as a very faint blanching macular rash on the thighs arms and lower abdomen 2 Application of a tourniquet to an arm for 5 minutes did not precipitate the development of petechiae The remainder of the physical examination was normal The red cell indexes anion gap and blood levels of glucose lactic acid lactate dehydrogenase and lipase were normal as were the results of liver function tests Other laboratory test results are shown in A rapid test for malaria antigen a pregnancy test and a polymerase chain reaction PCR test for influenza were negative Urinalysis showed slightly cloudy yellow urine with 1 ketones 1 occult blood a specific gravity of 012 and a pH of 0 on microscopic examination amorphous crystals and mucin were present and there were 0 to 2 red

hospital because of thrombocytopenia and abnormal results on an eye examination for red reflex and on a hearing screening The patient was born to a 27 year old mother gravida 2 para 2 by spontaneous vaginal delivery at another hospital after an uncomplicated gestation of 39 weeks 4 days His mother had received prenatal care in Nigeria and had also been seen by an obstetrician in New England for one office visit at 24 weeks 4 days of gestation At that appointment results of an ultrasonographic survey of the fetal anatomy were normal and antepartum screening tests for human immunodeficiency virus HIV hepatitis B virus hepatitis C virus and syphilis were negative A maternal test for IgG antibodies to rubella virus was positive 500 IU per milliliter reference range for immunity 9 as was a test for IgG antibodies to varicella zoster virus The maternal ABO blood type was O Rh positive and screening for antibodies to red cells was negative hemoglobin electrophoresis revealed the presence of hemoglobin AS The mother traveled back to Nigeria before returning to New England at 34 weeks of gestation in anticipation of the birth At delivery meconium was present The 1 minute and 5 minute Apgar scores were 7 and 8 respectively The birth weight was 21 kg 54th percentile the length 51 cm 72nd percentile and the head circumference 5 cm 22nd percentile The newborn had tremulous movements of the arms and legs and the blood glucose level was reportedly 20 mg per deciliter 1 mmol per liter He was admitted to the special care nursery at the other hospital where intravenous fluids that contained dextrose were administered and breast feeding was initiated the blood glucose level normalized On examination of the newborn the following day the vital signs were normal Scattered petechiae were present on the face and an eye examination revealed that the red reflex was absent in the left eye and decreased in the right eye The platelet count was 18 000 per cubic millimeter reference range 150 000 to 450 000 Newborn blood spot screening tests a panel of tests for multiple congenital diseases primarily inborn errors of metabolism revealed the presence of hemoglobin FAS and were otherwise negative On a hearing screening no auditory brain stem response was detected when the test sound was presented to either ear A polymerase chain reaction PCR assay for cytomegalovirus DNA in the urine was negative as was a maternal rapid plasma reagin test At 48 hours of age the patient was transferred to the neonatal ICU of this hospital for further evaluation and treatment The history was obtained from the patient s mother She reported that she was unsure whether the newborn responded to her voice or other sounds She had received treatment for malaria during the first trimester of pregnancy and had received amoxicillin clavulanate for a respiratory tract infection during the early part of the third trimester The family lived in an urban area of Nigeria where the parents worked in the banking sector and employed a live in nanny to help care for the patient s 3 year old sister They did not have pets and had not noted rodents or other pests in their home The patient s mother father and sister were healthy During the mother s previous pregnancy prenatal care had taken place exclusively in Nigeria the child had been delivered in the southeastern United States and the mother and child had traveled back to Nigeria shortly after the birth Otherwise the mother had not traveled internationally the father had traveled to China for business during the past year On examination in the neonatal ICU the newborn was awake and appeared well and the vital signs were normal Scattered petechiae were present on the face The red reflex was absent in both eyes A systolic ejection murmur grade 2 6 was heard in the left upper chest Mild hepatosplenomegaly was present Increased muscle tone was present in the arms and legs and intermittent suppressible rapid shaking movements occurred in the arms The remainder of the examination was normal The hemoglobin level hematocrit red cell count red cell indexes and blood levels of glucose alanine aminotransferase aspartate aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase were normal as were the results of coagulation tests other laboratory test results are shown in A blood sample was obtained for culture Ampicillin and gentamicin were administered intravenously and platelets were transfused Cranial ultrasonography was performed through the anterior fontanelle 1 Sagittal images showed multiple punctate echogenic foci in the periventricular white matter bilaterally a finding consistent with calcifications Punctate calcifications were also present in the basal ganglia Complex subependymal cysts were seen in the caudothalamic grooves bilaterally these were larger on the left side than on the right side There was mild dilatation of the left lateral ventricle Linear branching echogenic foci were present in the basal ganglia bilaterally a finding consistent with lenticulostriate vasculopathy Intracranial calcifications in the neonate may result from a variety of conditions Congenital infection is usually the first diagnostic consideration other causes include hypoxic ischemic injury neoplasm and genetic disorders The pattern of calcification in the periventricular white matter and basal ganglia in this patient is suggestive of congenital infection Subependymal cysts which were seen in this case may result from hemorrhage hypoxic ischemic injury or congenital infection These cysts may also result from rare metabolic and genetic disorders and may be seen in healthy newborns Lenticulostriate vasculopathy is the presence of hyperechogenic vessels in the basal ganglia or thalami on cranial ultrasonography This finding may be seen in healthy infants however it has been associated with infectious and noninfectious conditions and is most likely a nonspecific marker of perinatal brain injury In this patient chest radiography 2A revealed a normal heart and mediastinum and clear lungs There were thin transverse lucent bands in the proximal humeral metaphyses bilaterally Metaphyseal lucent bands in the neonate may result from changes associated with chronic stress or from congenital infections Other causes of metaphyseal lucent bands include metastatic neuroblastoma and leukemia
